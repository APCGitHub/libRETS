Version 1.3.0 - xx xxx 2008
  * Converted the http client model to allow for parallel
    search requests. Ticket #73.

Version 1.2.5 - 26 Nov 2008

  * Expose RETS_XML_UTF8_ENCODING to SWIG languages.
    Ticket #80.

  * Expose RetsSession::SetTimeout() to SWIG languages.
    Ticket #82.

  * Added "Y" as a valid value for truth in boolean comparisons in
    MetadataElements.

Version 1.2.4 - 17 Nov 2008

  * Add RetsSession.SetModeFlags to allow caching to be enabled
    in streaming mode (RetsSession::MODE_CACHE), to disable
    streaming mode (RetsSession::MODE_NO_STREAM), and to disable
    the "Expect: 100 Continue" header (RetsSession::MODE_NO_EXPECT).
    Tickets #59, #77 and #79.

  * Add RetsSession.SetTimeout() to establish a timeout value
    with libCURL. Ticket #68.

  * Add UTF-8 as an accetable character encoding.
    Ticket #80.

Version 1.2.3 - 9 Sep 2008

  * Added test-network target and httpServer to test actual 
    network activity in the test harness. Tickets #70 and #74.

  * Expose RetsSession.SetHttpLogName() to all languages. Ticket #71.

Version 1.2.2 - 29 Aug 2008

  * Updated KeyValueResponse parsing to allow for ISO characters.
    Ticket #40.

  * Consider http response of "0" to be successful. It is possible
    with the streaming enhancement to see no status if the http
    transaction hasn't yet completed. Ticket #62.

  * Correct regression with logging GetObject calls per Ticket #36.
    The streaming enhancement caused GetObject calls to always be
    logged.
    Ticket #63.

  * Enhanced .NET Search to include switch configurable options
    such that it can be included for debugging purposes on the
    Windows binary builds. Added RetsSession::GetLibraryVersion()
    to return a string of the current libRETS version.
    Ticket #64.

  * Added static GetLibraryVersion to RetsSession.
    Ticket #65.

  * Added API documentation and a new switch to "configure" that
    controls whether user or maintainer documentation is produced.

  * Added http proxy capability through RetsSession::SetProxy.
    Ticket #66

  * Improved exception handling so more detailed error information
    could be returned to .NET languages. Added RetsHttpException
    to handle cURL/http exceptions.
    Modeled on patch supplied by Tony Manhollan.
    Ticket #67.

  * Added some additional checking to the http transaction flow in an attempt
    to masquerade networking issues as 503 (service unavailable) erorrs when
    libCURL returns a zero status to us.
    Ticket #69.

  * Revised http logging methodology for SWIG bound languages and
    updated developer documentation accordingly. For all SWIG languages,
    RetsSession::SetHttpLogName("log.name") is all that is needed to 
    invoke http logging. Legacy usage is still supported.

  * Revised Librets-Version header to be "X-Librets-Version".

  * libCURL requirement updated to 7.18.2 to avoid some bugs in curl

Version 1.2.1 - 25 Jun 2008

  * Add Rets 1.7 support.
    Ticket #39.

  * Metadata field names and reserved values should be case insensitive.
    Ticket #57.

  * Add Perl interface.
    Ticket #52.
    
  * Add PHP interface.  (And added PHP to the windows binary build.)
    Ticket #51.

  * Add JAVA interface. On Unixen, you need to include --with-java-prefix and
    point it to the JDK as in --with-java-prefix=/usr/local/jdk1.6.0.
    Ticket #53.

Version 1.2.0 - 9 May 2008

  * Add "streaming" enhancement. This enhancement improves performance
    for larger fetches at expense of risking timeouts with the RETS server.
    This enhancement moves a significant portion of the search and retrieval
    logic into the SearchResultSet logic. As a result, when the SearchResultSet
    is first returned, it may not have retrieved any data from the RETS server.
    You can only be assured that at least one row has been retrieved by
    calling SearchResultSet::HasNext().
    Ticket #41.

Version 1.1.12 - 6 May 2008

  * Extend XML parsing for metadata to include ISO characters if specified.
    Ticket #54.

Version 1.1.11 - 1 Apr 2008

  * Add SWIG bindings to Autoconf based (unix) build.
    Ticket #31.
  * Do not log GetObject requests by default and provide new method 
    RetsSession::SetLogEverything() to override the new default.
    Ticket #36.
  * Expose SqlToDmqlCompiler to C#.
    Ticket #42.
  * Handle changes to curl-config in curl 7.17.x and later.
    Ticket #46.
  * Add MetadataTable::GetMinimumAsString() and GetMaximumAsString().
    Ticket #47.
  * Remove std_string.i and std_vector.i from swig to allow for
    default versions to be used.
    Ticket #49.
  * SqlToDmqlCompiler now accepts a ? as a value in a WHERE clause.
    Ticket #48  Not complete, as you cannot yet take action on that.

  * Throw an exception from various RetsSession methods that can be called
    without being properly logged in. Ticket #37.
  * Fix bug where non US-ASCII character in MLS data caused XML parsing to
    fail. Ticket #40.
  * Added SearchResultSet::HasMaxRows() in order to determine if MAXROWS
    was sent by the server. Ticket #43.
  * RetsMetadata::GetSearchHelp() added.

    use of the RetsSession.SetHttpLogger

  * For the languages supported by swig: map MetadataObject

  * The SQL to DMQL compiler (and its ANTLR dependency) are now
    optional.  This should only effect people using C++ and this
    functionality.
