Instructions for building on Mac OS X are nearly identical as the Unix
instructions in unix.txt.  MacPorts ports has many, if not all, of the
prerequisites.  Fink tends to be more out of date.

If you choose to build Boost, the following shell script on OS X 10.3
will install it into /usr/local:

-----
#!/bin/sh

export PYTHON_VERSION=2.3

TOOLS="-sTOOLS=darwin"
LIBS="--with-filesystem --with-date_time --with-program_options"
STAGE=stage
INSTALL="--prefix=/usr/local --layout=system install"

bjam $TOOLS $LIBS $STAGE
sudo bjam $TOOLS $LIBS $INSTALL
