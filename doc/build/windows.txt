
Installing the Prequisites
==========================

Due to modifications needed to make 3rd party libraries compile
against librets, binaries of all dependant libraries are stored in
Subversion.  are stored in Subversion.  Check out this repository in
the parent directory of the main librets directory:

  https://code.crt.realtors.org/svn/librets/vendor/windows/

The best Subversion client for Windows is TortoiseSVN:

  http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/

You then need to install Microsoft Visual C++ and a Java JDK.

Microsoft Visual C++
--------------------

  Version: 2003.  Earlier version have buggy C++ support.
  URL: http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/

Only building from the command line is supported.  Install Visual C++
2003 or Visual Studio .NET 2003 and make sure to run vcvars32.bat from
the command line to setup VC++ environment variables and add the tools
to the path.

Java SDK
--------

  Version: 1.4.2 or higher.
  URL: http://java.sun.com/


Customizing config.vc
=====================

Copy the <librets>/project/build/config.vc.dist file to
<librets>/project/build/config.vc.  Edit BASE_PATH to point to the
full path of the dependant libries that were checked out from
Subversion, above.  The following table shows the four possible
library names:

  BUILD    | RUNTIME_LIBS | Library Name
  ---------+--------------+----------------
  debug    | static       | libretsmtd.lib
  ---------+--------------+----------------
  release  | static       | libretsmt.lib
  ---------+--------------+----------------
  debug    | dynamic      | libretsd.lib
  ---------+--------------+---------------
  release  | dynamic      | librets.lib


Building librets
================

From the command line, run the following command:

  % nmake -f Makefile.vc

This will create the specified library in:

  project/librets/src/build

To build all four library variants, run the following command:

  % make -f Makefile.vc lib-all-variants

The header files needed to use librets are in:

  project/librets/include

You will need Boost to use librets, as well, as librets returns many
pointers as Boost shared pointers (boost::shared_ptr).  You do not
need the other libraries when compling against librets.
