
Installing the Prerequisites
==========================

Due to modifications needed to make 3rd party libraries compile
against librets and to aid people who ONLY want to work on libRETS
code, binaries of all dependant libraries are stored in Subversion.
Check out this repository in the parent directory of the main librets
directory:

  https://code.crt.realtors.org/svn/librets/vendor/windows/

A good Subversion client for Windows is TortoiseSVN:

  http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/

You then need to install Microsoft Visual C++ and a Java JDK.

If you want to get the source to libRETS out of subversion you can
checkout from the repository using this base URL:

  https://code.crt.realtors.org/svn/librets/librets

Following common SVN practice, under that URL are tags, branches,
and trunk directories.


Microsoft Visual C++
--------------------

  Version: 2003.  Earlier version have buggy C++ support.
  URL: http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/

Only building from the command line is supported.  Install Visual C++
2003 or Visual Studio .NET 2003 and make sure to run vcvars32.bat from
the command line to setup VC++ environment variables and add the tools
to the path.

Java SDK
--------

  Version: 1.4.2 or higher.
  URL: http://java.sun.com/


In case anyone needs/wants to build from scratch, here is a list of
the rest of the dependencies, but these can be found in the windows
binary tree in subversion listed above.

Boost
-----

  Version: 1.32.0 or higher.
  URL: http://www.boost.org/

Boost has its own build system, bjam.  Read its instructions for
installation.  You need to compile and install the filesystem and
program options libraries.

libcurl
-------

  Version: 7.13.2 or higher.
  URL: http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

Build as per its instructions.  No special steps are needed.

Expat
-----

  Version: 1.95.8 or higher.
  URL: http://expat.sourceforge.net/    

Build as per its instructions.  No special steps are needed.

ANTLR
-----

  Version: 2.7.5 or higher.
  URL: http://www.antlr.org/

Build as per its instructions.  No special steps are needed.


Customizing config.vc
=====================

Copy the <librets>/project/build/config.vc.dist file to
<librets>/project/build/config.vc. Edit BASE_PATH to point to the
full path of the dependant libraries that were checked out from
Subversion, above.  The following table shows the four possible
library names:

  BUILD    | RUNTIME_LIBS | Library Name
  ---------+--------------+----------------
  debug    | static       | libretsmtd.lib
  ---------+--------------+----------------
  release  | static       | libretsmt.lib
  ---------+--------------+----------------
  debug    | dynamic      | libretsd.lib
  ---------+--------------+---------------
  release  | dynamic      | librets.lib


Building librets
================

From the command line, run the following command:

  % nmake -f Makefile.vc

This will create the specified library in:

  project/librets/src/build

To build all four library variants, run the following command:

  % make -f Makefile.vc lib-all-variants

The header files needed to use librets are in:

  project/librets/include

You will need Boost to use librets, as well, as librets returns many
pointers as Boost shared pointers (boost::shared_ptr).  You do not
need the other libraries when compiling against librets.
