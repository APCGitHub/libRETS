
Installing the Prequisites
==========================

Microsoft Visual C++
--------------------

  Version: 2003.  Earlier version have buggy C++ support.
  URL: http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/

Only building from the command line is supported.  Install Visual C++
2003 or Visual Studio .NET 2003 and make sure to run vcvars32.bat from
the command line to setup VC++ environment variables and add the tools
to the path.

librets also only builds in multithreaded, static mode, the /MT
command line flag.  This requires that all dependant libraries be
compiled with /MT.

Boost
-----

  Version: 1.32.0 or higher.
  URL: http://www.boost.org/

Download and unzip the source archive in the directory as the toplevel
librets directory.  Boost has it's own build tool, called bjam.  You
can download it from the Boost website.  Compile boost with the
following command:

  % bjam "-sTOOLS=vc-7_1" --with-filesystem --with-program_options stage

libcurl
-------

  Version: 7.13.2 or higher.
  URL: http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

Download and unzip the source archive in the directory as the toplevel
librets directory.  You need to edit lib/Makefile.vc6.  You need to
change /MD and /MDd to /MT and /MTd to ensure the correct runtime
libraries.  Then run this command from the top level Curl directory:

  % nmake vc

Expat
-----

  Version: 1.95.8 or higher.
  URL: http://expat.sourceforge.net/    

You can download and install the Windows binary, expat_win32bin.

Java SDK
--------

  Version: 1.4.2 or higher.
  URL: http://java.sun.com/

Java is required to build and use ANTLR (see below).

Cygwin
------

  Version: 1.5.18-1 or higher.
  URL: http://www.cygwin.com/

Cygwin is required to build ANTLR (see below).

ANTLR
-----

  Version: 2.7.5 or higher.
  URL: http://www.antlr.org/

Download and unzip the source archive in the directory as the toplevel
librets directory.  Open up a Cygwin shell prompt, and run the
following commands:

  % ./configure --disable-csharp --disable-python --prefix=c:/antlr/antlr-2.7.5
  % export CXXFLAGS="+ /MTd"
  % make
  % make install

Building librets
================

From the command line, run the following command:

  % nmake -f Makefile.vc

This will create the library:

  project/librets/src/release/librets.lib

The header files needed to use librets are in:

  project/librets/include

You will need Boost to use librets, as well, as librets returns many
pointers as Boost shared pointers (boost::shared_ptr).  You do not
need the other libraries when compling against librets.
