Example code in this directory requires Python 2.7.

The actual libRETS extension module works on all Python versions supported by
SWIG, however, which might even include versions as far back as 2.0. The SWIG
documentation at http://www.swig.org/Doc2.0/Python.html states:

"""
SWIG is compatible with most recent Python versions including Python 3.0 and
Python 2.6, as well as older versions dating back to Python 2.0. For the best
results, consider using Python 2.3 or newer.
